Every expression written in the Java programming language has a type that can be deduced from the structure of the expression and the types of the literals,variables, and methods mentioned in the expression.

widening conversion:
int y = 3;
float x=y; // widening conversion , no error

Narrowing conversion:
float x = 3.4f;
int y = x; // narrowing conversion, error

int y =(int)x; //no error

float k = 3.5; // narrowing conversion, error

float k = 3.5f;// no error
